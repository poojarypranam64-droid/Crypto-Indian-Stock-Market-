    <h1>Digital Currencies: A Modern Alternative</h1>
    <p>
      Digital currencies are an ideal alternative to national currencies (fiat money) due to their 
      decentralized network system, which uses a peer-to-peer payment network powered by blockchain technology. 
    </p>

    <h2>Blockchain Technology</h2>
    <p>
      Blockchain technology uses a cryptographic protocol system to create new entities and protect all transactions 
      that are processed and executed. These units are called <strong>blocks</strong>, and they connect in a chain 
      to ensure that each cryptocurrency remains safe and secure.
    </p>

    <h2>Mining Process</h2>
    <p>
      The money is stored across several computers within a unique network. This process is called 
      <strong>mining</strong>â€”a method that validates and secures every cryptocurrency transaction.
    </p>

    <h2>Digital Wallets</h2>
    <p>
      To buy or hold any cryptocurrency, a <strong>wallet</strong> is required. These wallets can be software-based, 
      also known as digital wallets, in the form of programs such as <em>Binance</em>, <em>Luno</em>, or <em>Blockchain</em>. 
      Digital wallets are used to store and verify all crypto transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every digital wallet is assigned a unique address that consists of long codes containing letters and numbers. 
      These codes are extremely difficult to decipher or hack, making digital wallets highly secure.
